            <p>
              The key theme throughout <span class="sam">_SAM</span> is "time" -
              how time is spent, focused, wasted, dedicated, abused,
              appreciated. How time is taken for granted. How time is stolen.
              How time should be treasured. How time may truly the most
              important thing we have.
            </p>

            <p>
              Work began on <span class="sam">_SAM</span> on 1st January 2024 as
              a New Year's resolution and it was released on 31st December 2024
              - New Year's Eve.
            </p>
            <p>
              The original idea for this release was a
              <span class="sam">Song A Month</span> project, where I'd write,
              record and release a song each month. I wanted to dedicate
              focussed effort on improving my recording and production skills,
              so each month could serve as a snapshot of progress, the most
              honest artistic diary I could keep.
            </p>
            <p>
              January, February and March all went to plan, but when I got to
              April, things fell apart a little. I'd written my song for that
              month but I just couldn't find the time or space to record it
              properly. I ended up taking a short break from recording, which
              became a long break, which became considerably longer than I'd
              planned. I essentially fell into an artistic paralysis over the
              recording of this one song.
            </p>
            <p>
              In November, with the end of the year in sight, I took a week off
              work and focused on re-recording April's song, alongside recording
              two other songs I'd written since then.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unintentionally splitting the creative year has resulted in
              <span class="sam">_SAM</span>
              being something of a two-act release. Personally, I found some odd
              symmetries between the two halves, so reordered the track list
              away from being directly chronological to compliment the overall
              musical shape shape, built around the abstract pairings of tracks
              1-6, 2-5 and 3-4.
            </p>
            <p>It makes me happy to think of them like that anyway.</p>

                track that I wrote on 1st January 2024.
                <span class="source-title">Monday Music Making</span> is a
                weekly project where I take about an hour to write and release
                something - it's essentially a living sketchbook. Here's the

              <li>
                My understanding of a Peacock Vow primarily comes from
                <a

                - "medieval knights had their own version of the New Year’s
                resolution". The article also finishes with one of my favourite
                sentiments: "In our culture of relentless self-perfection, we
                could use the reminder that sometimes graciousness beats out
                flawlessness." Thank you Katy Waldman.
              </li>

              <li>
                The song's lyrics are greatly inspired by the sentiments within
                <span class="source-title">Essentialism</span> by
                <a
                  href="https://gregmckeown.com/books/essentialism/"

                  >Greg McKeown</a
                >. For me, the book largely extolls the virtues of being
                immensely selective by where we put our time and efforts,
                championing the less in favour of the more. A simplistic
                reduction is "Do less, better", which is honestly how I tried to
                approach 2024.
              </li>
              <li>
                Musically I wanted to keep the harmony as simply as possible,
                keeping a low drone throughout and focusing on a handful of
                chords. Gradually I built up the instrumentation around the
                players of the
                <span class="jacksorjacksor">JacksorJacksor</span> live band,
                which roughly works out to be two flute parts, two Bb
                instrumental parts (in this case played on clarinets), keyboard
                and rhythm section.
              </li>
              <li>
                The line "Don't forget your feet when ascending" is based on
                basic advice for learning to climb. I spent a lot of 2023 going
                bouldering, and one of the first things I was taught was to
                focus on footwork - a strong foundation leads to a higher reach.
              </li>
              <li>
                The piano arpeggios use patterns based around those found in
                Chopin's Etude Op 10 No 1 in C major.
              </li>
              <li>
                The drum settings kept resetting every time I opened the
                project. Genuinely the most annoying part about working on this
                song and I still don't know why. Render your VSTs, folks.

                The distorted piano sound is an homage to listening to in-flight

              <li>
                This song was initially inspired by Seasonal Affective Disorder
                and was very much representing "how I'm feeling right now".
              </li>
              <li>
                The line “The dark bleaches colour from my mind” is a reference
                to Spike Milligan's poem
                <span class="source-title">My Daughter Of 5 - Jane</span>
                (which is in his "Hidden Words" collection). The poem talks
                about the poet's daughter “colouring his tired mind” whereas
                this song is about the darkness stealing that colour. Having
                read that poem I have tried to be more aware of the colours of
                my own emotions, and what things might be dulling them, or
                helping them to shine.
              </li>

                I made a

                >
                going through the Reaper DAW session where I made this song.
              </li>
              <li>
                The majority of the piano parts are recorded at double speed,
                then played back at normal speed. This means the audio is played
                back down an octave, but with a more drawn out, deeper texture
                than just pitch shifting.
              </li>
              <li>
                The piano trills section around the midpoint is a little nod to
                Ravel's <span class="source-title">Daphnis et Chloé</span>.
              </li>
              <li>
                This song almost uses all 12 major chords - annoyingly I
                realised the G major chord is G/E, which is really closer to
                Em7, but I still like to think all 12 are in there. The closing
                "Colour Me In" section was built around the chords I hadn't used
                in the song yet - I specifically wrote out all 12 chords and
                crossed off the ones I had used, then only used the ones that
                were left over. Damn you, Em7
                <span class="italic">(shakes fist at chord)</span>.
              </li>
              <li>
                The ending ascending organ pattern uses some fun voice leading
                to keep the chord going up for ever. Real musical joy to work
                out I could do that.

                "Wine-dark" is a term, used in contexts such as the

                by authors such as Homer in the Odyssey ("And what if one of the
                gods does wreck me out on the wine-dark sea?"), before there was

                To me, this song is about having time stolen by someone,
                acknowledging that you'll never get that back, and that you need
                to move on. There's also an acknowledgement that your feelings
                are valid, no matter how rational they may be - as Kae Tempest
                says in

              <li>
                I wrote this song when I was ill with COVID (my first time!).
                Maybe a sense of being frustrated, being sick and tired of being
                sick and tired, crept in.
              </li>
              <li>
                Our last show of 2024 was at St John's Church, Canton, Cardiff
                on November 16th, and I realised this was the one song I'd
                written but hadn't performed with the band. This specific show
                featured a reduced
                <span class="jacksorjacksor">JacksorJacksor</span> line-up of
                me, Vicky Guise on flute and Tania Drewitt-Jones on 'cello, so I
                wrote the arrangement for those players, and with that
                performance in mind. Vicky and Tania are utterly incredible and
                so when it came to recording the song they had to be on it.
              </li>
              <li>
                The song also features a recording of the sea, recorded at
                Penarth seafront. As a member of
                <a href="https://dawnstalkers.com/" target="_blank"
                  >Dawnstalkers</a
                >
                I have developed a strong connection to swimming in that water,
                and it felt correct to include the sea as a featured artist.
              </li>
              <li>
                The flute part involves lots of grace notes with lots of fifths.
                This was an active decision to create a less harmonically
                defined part, aiming for more of a primitive feel. Given the
                sound world and imagery, Vicky said that she found herself
                thinking of works by Takamitsu as a tonal reference.
              </li>
              <li>
                The 'cello part was partly inspired by the opening of Benjamin
                Britten'sA Midsummer Night's Dream
                <span class="source-title">A Midsummer Night's Dream</span>.
                Tania and I have a shared love of Britten, so I'll leap at any
                opportunity I can to give them little Britten references.
              </li>
              <li>
                The closing guitar part uses a double bass bow to bow the
                chords, put through my pedal board. I relearned to use my bow
                when playing electric double bass for Freyja Elsy's live band,
                and it's been a joy to start using the bow in other contexts.
                Thank you Mel Smith for giving me a quick double bass bow hold
                refresher lesson!

                The lead vocals were recorded at Musicbox Studios, Cardiff.
                Despite having all the equipment at home, I really wanted to
                dedicate focused time to the vocals, to record in a separate
                space to everything else. All the lead and backing vocals for
                Wine-dark, Backbone and Boundless were recorded in a three-hour
                session at Musicbox Studios, aiming to create a sense of
                scarcity and dedication that recording or filming to tape does.
                Whatever came out of that session would be the material I had to
                use. No round two. I took a lot from this experience and would
                strongly recommend it in future.

              <li>
                This song is largely based around the current climate crisis,
                and is somewhat indebted to ANOHNI's
                <a

              </li>
              <li>
                The song directly references the likes of activists such as Wynn
                Alan Bruce who have literally sacrificed themselves for what
                they believe.
              </li>
              <li>
                The line "As expected the world fell apart" is a direct quote
                from Takahiro Takayama, the Lead Physics Programmer on
                <span class="source-title">
                  The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom </span

                worlds with how we treat out current one to be fascinating.
              </li>
              <li>
                The guitar part was originally written as an homage to The
                Smile's <span class="source-title">Thin Thing</span>.
              </li>
              <li>
                For the choruses I wanted to create a strangely artificial joy,
                somewhere between Porter Robinson and the NieR: Automata OST.
              </li>
              <li>
                The chopped vocals naturally evolved from the glitchy feel of
                the choruses, and then made their way throughout much of the
                song.
              </li>
              <li>
                All the flutes, clarinets and piano are sequenced digitally
                (i.e. not actual players) to reinforce the artificial nature of
                the song. The arrangement also references my earlier song
                <a
                  href="https://jacksorjacksor.bandcamp.com/track/zephyr"
                  target="_blank"
                  >Zephyr</a
                >, which was a fully instrumental piece. This song helped me to
                bridge the gap between that world and my current production.
              </li>
              <li>
                The song ends by being crumbled into the bin musically. I am so
                proud of doing this as it feels like something I would have
                wanted to do when I was much younger but wouldn't have know how
                to do. It's honestly a gift to past me if nothing else. This
                section is also an homage to Severini's
                <span class="source-title">Mare = Ballerina</span>, where the
                paint literally escapes the canvas. It's also more literally
                about, you know, things falling apart.

                This recording features Vicky Guise on flute and Tania

              <li>
                I ended up rewriting the second half of the 'cello's pizz
                section during the recording session. It was a joy to just be
                able to rewrite the part (on manuscript paper) and just hand it
                to the performer (Tania!) to sightread perfectly and use that.
                That truly was a fun and special moment for me.
              </li>
              <li>
                There's a short section of just flutes and clarinets,
                specifically after the line "Oh to stop for a moment, just for a
                moment, please". This section was inspired by Hayao Miyazaki
                discussing the idea of "Ma" - "a necessary stillness inserted
                within the action" - and how it is used in his films, such as
                <a
                  href=" https://screencraft.org/blog/hayao-miyazaki-says-ma-is-an-essential-storytelling-tool/"

              <li>
                The key rhythms move between fours and threes (semiquavers and
                triplets) and transitions between staccato and legato. To me
                these have came to represent internal conflicts and mixed
                messaging within the narrative. As the song goes on, these
                transitions stabilise somewhat, which I'd like to think reflect
                a resolution of sorts (oh, and shout-outs to Ethel Merman's
                <span class="source-title">Something For The Boys</span>).
              </li>
              <li>
                The chorus rhythm was based on a misremembering of Radiohead's
                <span class="source-title">Pulk / Pull Revolving Doors</span> -
                specifically in
                <span class="source-title">
                  Pulk / Pull (True Love Waits Version) </span
                >. I have a love of going off what I remember instead of going
                back to actually check what was really the case (i.e. my memory
                had transformed the song into something new), which I found
                Thomas Ades did with his arrangement of Madness's
                <span class="source-title">Cardiac Arrest</span>. That approach
                also compliments my reading of this Maya Angelou quote: "People
                will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but
                people will never forget how you made them feel".
              </li>
              <li>
                Much of the song is about recognising and accepting the
                different parts of one's self. I was introduced to this notion
                in counselling, specifically referencing Jung's ideas around
                <a

                  >Shadow</a
                >. This is also a concept at the narrative heart of the game

                with my whole heart.

                All my time is mine, I’m the captain of my focus and<br />
                Lights still leave me blind, but only when I let them<br />
                Oh, it’s the fear that kills, the fear that destroys,<br />
                White noise, confusion, panic<br />
                Oh to stop for a moment, just for a moment, please<br />
              </p>

              <p>
                How deep is the line in the sand I drew,<br />
                To keep out the other versions of me<br />
                I wish I could see them,<br />
                I wish I could see them,<br />
                And know them,<br />
                And forgive them,<br />
                and embrace them<br />
                And be at one with me<br />
              </p>

              <p>
                And if I'd say the words I would be unbounded<br />
                And if I stay the course I could be yours forever<br />
              </p>

            <p>
              I put this page together as a communication exercise, to find a
              way to share my thoughts about my work on my own platform, outside
              of the confines of social media tropes and formats. I honestly
              just had a lot of things I wanted to share about the record! It
              should go without saying that what's here is in no way exhaustive,
              and that these are more starting points than a full picture.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also want to work more to cultivate my own digital space in a
              similar way, giving extra context to the music I release in the
              format I feel is most appropriate for the media. I increasingly
              feel that artists need to have more agency and control over their
              pocket of the internet, so this is me starting to explore what
              that feels like in 2024.
            </p>
            <p>
              This site was written as one page of HTML, one page of CSS, and
              uses a bit of Bootstrap 5, uploaded to a server using Filezilla. I
              got myself stuck overthinking tech stacks, so this version at
              least is just the most basic site I could possibly make.
              Eventually I'll refactor into into Umbraco with Astro (which, for
              reference, I
              <a
                href="https://skrift.io/issues/doctales-collaborative-documentation-for-umbraco-and-astro-js/"
                >co-wrote the documentation on</a
              >), but that's not for right now - I just wanted to make
              something, and that is this.
            </p>
            <p>Done is better than perfect - I promise you.</p>
